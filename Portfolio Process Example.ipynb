The requirement for the information is to transform it into reports that are in a format accepted by external companies, as well as in a way that is more useful for internal users.\n","\n","### Design\n","\n","The output for these reports are simple excel formats, with data summarised into several columns. There are two main versions of these reports, list of holdings (from SecurityDesc) and cash and fund values (from Fund Trend). The other version is similar, but also adds an additional column for holdings as a % of fund value. To streamline this process, we will implement one table which houses a concatenation of data from both SecuirtyDesc and FundTrend, adding in the % column, to then be further transfromed into the final reports."],"metadata":{"id":"H4oyCVVOOJHH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Implementation"],"metadata":{"id":"Kzp7CzVOOqHr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Imports"],"metadata":{"id":"BM8QT4uIOya1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from pyspark.sql.functions import *\n","from pyspark.sql.types import *\n","from notebookutils import fs"],"metadata":{"id":"XofpsPILO3UL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Get Data"],"metadata":{"id":"FoPehsaWO7iu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dfsec = spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM Marlborough_Lakehouse.brz_securitydesc\").toPandas()\n","dftren = spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM Marlborough_Lakehouse.brz_fundtrendclass\").toPandas()"],"metadata":{"id":"Qyw8rrpdO9Z5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Remove Unnecessary Columns"],"metadata":{"id":"SEMxKUZCPDqW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dfsec = dfsec[['Security_Number',\n","'Shares_Par',\n","'Security_Description_Short',\n","'Strike_Price',\n","'Traded_Market_Value_Base',\n","'Trading_Currency',\n","'Position_Date',\n","'Account_Name',\n","'Security_ISIN']]\n","\n","dftren = dftren[['Account_Name',\n","'Net_Income_Amount',\n","'OEIC_Uninvested_Principal_Cash_Bid',\n","'OEIC_Security_Value',\n","'Cancellation_Value',\n","'Net_Unrealized_G/L_On_FEC',\n","'Account_Class',\n","'Date_As_Date']]"],"metadata":{"id":"fdNTcLDqPNSS"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
